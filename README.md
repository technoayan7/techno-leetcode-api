## About ‚ú®

At First, I struggled to find proper documentation for the `leetcode.com/graphql`. After scouring various articles about the LeetCode public API, I still couldn't find the comprehensive documentation I was looking for. Fueled by the desire to fill this gap I created **techno-leetcode-api**.

**techno-leetcode-api** is a custom solution born out of the need for a well-documented and detailed LeetCode API. This project is designed to provide developers with endpoints that offer insights into a user's profile, badges, solved questions, contest details, contest history, submissions, and also daily questions, selected problem, list of problems.

## API URL üåê

```
https://techno-leetcode-api.vercel.app/
```

### üí° Rate Limit

I've implemented a rate limit to prevent any potential server overload issues.

During development, it's recommended to utilize the API locally. To do so, follow this documentation => <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">Local Deploy</a>
